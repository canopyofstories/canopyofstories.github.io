                People who commute by bike, experience this perplexing phenomenon every single day. Bike lanes abruptly disappear. Painted lines fade out, only to come back again at traffic stops. Like a tokenistic bone, thrown with a "here". And the moment that light turns green, you're on your own again. The lanes that do exist, exist threateningly close to cars travelling at 80km/hr where one stray tug could send a biker flying. With laws that make it illegal to cycle on sidewalks above a certain age, and because the only infrastructure you're left with is disjointed, or nonexistent, the message is overwhelmingly clear.

                CYCLING TO WORK has been proven to increase overall wellbeing by reducing stress levels and disease risks, while providing the sustainability of integrated physical activity into one's daily routine. 
                
                <br><br>
                It also decreases weekly expenses, while greatly reducing one's carbon footprint. This quickly compounds as a great means of reducing carbon emissions, if more people saw cycling as a viable means of transportation. For others, it's the only viable means of transportation they can afford.

                BIKING ROUTES don't need to look like half-hazard paint lines, fighting for road real estate. New biking infrastructure is a wonderful opportunity for collaborative, sustainable, community-oriented design. It can look like lush greenways, woven through parks. It can be bike paths connecting shopping districts and community centres. Bike routes on roads, where the lane is separated from traffic and lined with small bollards, away from the threat of swinging car-parked doors, is the only road bike lane that makes sense.

                Many train stations in Melbourne feature free secure bike cages called Parkiteer. These bike cages make it possible for longer commutes to school, shops and work, allowing more flexibility and accessibility to varying lifestyles and demands of the day.

                THE ARGUMENT isn't to ban cars. The argument is to provide choice. Real choice, by prioritising the safety and practicality of other transport too. 
                <br><br>
                If you've ridden a bike before, you know the joy of feeling the wind in your hair (or across your scalp). It's invigorating and brings back a sense of play and childhood laughter that lightens up your heart and day. Imagine you get to feel that everyday, twice a day. Instead of being stuck in a metal tank punctuated by the impatient taps of the capitalist clock.
